        /* how do you add the elements to the stack ? mmmmmm? okay 
		let us think 
        way ,lets add all the ascending order elements to the stack so that 
		it
        looks like climbing steps .coz in that way we can have atleast the 
		min
        size step * number of elements in the stack .if we encounter any 
		bar with         lesser height than the top element of the stack ,we 
		will compute the 
        existing stack element area and pop the top element just to check 
		if the 
        current top < bar height ,if it is so ..add it to the stack ..i think it        
		will be more clearer if you go through the code*/
